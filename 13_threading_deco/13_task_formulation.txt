Find a script attached below, you would need to implement the parts marked with #TODO.

You should modify/add code ONLY between the lines # MODIFY-START and # MODIFY-END.

You should NOT modify any other existing code.

 

1)     Make the code work.

2)     Make long_long_function() function accept a filename, and store last 10 lines (or less) in another file named “truncated_%filename%”.
For example, last 10 lines (or less) from file “lorem_ipsum.txt” must be copied into new “truncated_lorem_ipsum.txt”
You can generate the files content here: https://www.lipsum.com/ or get anywhere you like, it does not matter.

3)     Implement “threaded_execution” decorator so that every call of a decorated function gets called in a separate thread.
This must lead to overall run time reduction, in comparison to linear code -> this will make the last assertion to pass successfully.
