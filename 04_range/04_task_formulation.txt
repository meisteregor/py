Create a function “arange” that duplicates “xrange” in Python2, but can handle Long numeric type.

It must support positional and/or key arguments, negative numbers for any of the argument, just like xrange does.

The function must implementer as a generator, avoid any iterable return types like lists, tuples or what not.

g = arange(1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000)

g = arange(30L, 2)

g = arange(8, start=2, step=-3L)

g = arange(9, 999, 7)

etc…

 

You may not implement certain cases of negative stepping etc., but the main requirement is that the function must not hang or stuck in an infinite loop in any case.

At the very least, I must see a warning that such case is not allowed/not supported. If so, it would be nice of you to list the scenarios not supported or implemented yet.
